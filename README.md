# team-profile-generator

## Description
A cli application that after installation allows the user to run it, and create a basic html page that displays a team of developers!
It asks the users a series of questions, that lets the user set the name of the project/group, the name and role of each employee, such as manager, engineer, or intern. Each class has its own set of questions after that!

## Installation
Simply go to my github (github.com/snerowski) navigate to the repository team-profile-generator, and then clone it to your command line. After that just run npm install!

## Usage 
After the app has been installed, open the terminal at the root level and run `node index.js`, after that the user is prompted with all of the questions! answer each one and once you have added the amount of team members you wish answer No for the last question and the app generates the template for you!
